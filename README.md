# Webots-three-jar

Project Overview:

In this project I programed a webots Tiago robot to use a lidar to map its environment then utilize A* search to drive to a specific location and pick up jars. The robot uses its arm whose position is calculated using the ikpy library. The robot brings the jars to the table in the environment.

The environment used is the webots default kitchen with the chairs around the table removed.

How to use:

Firstly, it is required that webots is downloaded on your computer, which is available here: https://cyberbotics.com/

Then, to run the simulation, navigate to the worlds folder and open the kitch_behavior_tree file
